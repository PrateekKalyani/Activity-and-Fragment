I have read Activity Lifecycle from the following links -:

    1- https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle

    2- https://www.javatpoint.com/android-life-cycle-of-activity

    3- The project name "MyApplication" is the same project as in the 2'nd link.
       I have added 2 activities and one button to switch between the fragment.
       This application is to learn more about the activity life cycle. 

I have read about fragment from the YouTube PlayList-:

    2- The application "Fragment Lifecycle" contains a fragment in the Main Activity. 
       This application is to learn the Lifecycle of the Fragment.
       This application helped me learn how it is coupled with the activity lifecycle.

    3- The application "Fragment Practice Application" contains 2 fragments.
       I am switching between them using a "Switch Fragment" button.
